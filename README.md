# ANN Churn Modelling

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**.  
Customer churn prediction helps businesses identify customers who are likely to leave and take proactive actions to improve retention.

The model is developed using **TensorFlow and Keras** and trained on the **Churn Modelling dataset from Kaggle**.
